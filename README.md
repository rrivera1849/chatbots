# Chatbots

Developing conversational agents, also called chatbots, is a new hot topic within the artificial intelligence community. 
The purpose of these agents is to be able to learn how to carry out a conversation with a human user. 
These agents have the potential of changing how customers interact with companies and open up new business opportunities 
where the primary mode of customer interaction is through textual conversation. In this project, we explore a retrieval-based model 
on the Ubuntu Dialog Corpus and use a basic Sequence to Sequence model on a publicly available twitter dataset.
